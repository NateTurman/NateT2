# Week 1
**Monday**- We went into Mr Morts room and followed his instructions to set up the student repository.

**Tuesday**- I got more comfortable with the visual studio code and started typing things on my website.

**Wednesday***- Read more on Linux Shell and Bash setup. Learn what each code means on know how to do them.

Ex: cd vscode

git clone (link)

This code copys the studet repository example onto vscode so I can make this website.

**Thursday**- I learned how to insert images and what to do with my website to get a good grade.

**Friday**- I worked with my partner and went over the plan for next week and the upcoming live reveiw.
