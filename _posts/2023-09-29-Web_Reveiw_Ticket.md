# HTML 
For the HTML web basic I created a short paragraph and a button that gives you a notification when you click it. I then added to 2 links that go to helpful websites for coding. I then added another paragraph at the bottom.

# DataTypes 
For the JavaScript I added a list of things and an array of my name, age, classes, favorite color, and my pets. 

# JAvaScript
For java script I aded something that compare the ages between two variables. If the a variable is less that the b it will show up as "a is less than b."
