**Wednesday**- On the first day of school we didn't do much. We read over the course description and hacks. I didn't have a chromebook that could run visuall code so I couldn't do much

**Thursday**-On Thursday we chose our partners for the rest of the trimester. These partners will do all the live reviews and projects with us.

**Friday**- On Friday we went over the tangibles and hacks that we need to know.
