# My Hacks
 I learned to go around my obstacles in my code such as the links not taking my to the right place. To solve this I had to stop the server, edit the links, and the run the server again and then it finally worked.

 Another hack that I had was the snake game not working everytime I changed something in the code. I fixed this by making the code more simple and asking chatgtp where the problem in my code is and then inputting the new code in.
