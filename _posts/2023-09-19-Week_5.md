**Monday**-We had monday off this week so I didn't do much.

**Tuesday**-On Tuesday I added exponets to my caculator and did trial and error to see if it worked. At first it wouldn't work because it would just have the sum come out as 0. I fixed that but then it gave me the wrong answer. Finally I went back and looked at my code and found the problem and then it worked.

**Wednesday**-On Wednesday I got a really bad migrane so I got Checked out and didn't do anything.

**Thursday**-On Thursday I did the caculator live reveiw because i missed it on Wednesday. 

**Friday**- On Friday I started working on my sprite and reading about it.
