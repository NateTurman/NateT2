 - Working out
  : I work out 4-5 times a week for my sport. I mostly do plyometrics and cardio.
  - Food
   : My favorite food is sushi. Sushi is great because there are many different kinds of sushi and each and everyone has multiple ingredients and tastes.

# My Favorite Animals
- Honey Badger
 : Honey badgers are the best animal because they do not care about who they are attacking or what. They have the strongest mentality and have a strong immunity to snake venom. HOney badgers like to eat scorpions and snakes. 
- Mantis Shrimp
 : The mantis shrimp is a small but deadly animal. It is the Mike Tyson of the animal world. A mantis shrimps punch is compared to a bullet leaving the barrel of the gun.
